# ❄️ Winter Revision Session – DSA Roadmap (GFG & LeetCode)

This repository documents my **Winter Revision Session** focused on mastering **Data Structures & Algorithms** by solving **Easy, Medium, and Hard** problems deeply on **GeeksforGeeks** and **LeetCode**.  
All solutions are **implemented, tested locally in VS Code**, and then **pushed to GitHub** for consistency and version control.

---

## 🎯 Objectives
- Build **strong fundamentals** through Easy problems  
- Develop **problem-solving depth** via Medium problems  
- Tackle **edge cases, optimizations, and patterns** using Hard problems  
- Maintain a **clean workflow**: Solve → Test Locally → Push to GitHub  

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack & Environment
- **Language:** C++  
- **Editor:** Visual Studio Code  
- **Platforms:** GeeksforGeeks, LeetCode  
- **Version Control:** Git & GitHub

## 📚 Problem Solving Roadmap

### 🟢 Easy Level (Foundation)
Focus:
- Basic logic & implementation
- Arrays, Strings, Hashing
- Simple Recursion & Math

Goal:
- Improve **speed**
- Avoid **silly mistakes**
- Write **clean and readable code**

---

### 🟡 Medium Level (Core Concepts)
Focus:
- Sliding Window
- Two Pointers
- Stack & Queue
- Binary Search
- Trees & Linked Lists
- Greedy & Basic DP

Goal:
- Understand **why** the solution works
- Handle **edge cases**
- Optimize **time and space complexity**

---

### 🔴 Hard Level (Advanced Thinking)
Focus:
- Advanced DP
- Graphs
- Tries
- Monotonic Stack / Deque
- Complex Edge Cases

Goal:
- Build **intuition**
- Learn **problem patterns**
- Strengthen **interview readiness**

---

## 🔄 Workflow Followed

1. Read & understand the problem thoroughly  
2. Think about **brute force → optimized approach**  
3. Implement solution in **VS Code**  
4. Test with **custom & edge cases**  
5. Refactor for **clarity & efficiency**  
6. Push final solution to **GitHub**
